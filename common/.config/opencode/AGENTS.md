# OpenCode Working Agreement

This is a shared working agreement between you (Luke) and me (OpenCode).
It applies globally across coding projects unless a project-specific
`AGENTS.md` says otherwise.

## Core Preferences

1. Prefer functional programming wherever practical.
   - Favor pure functions, immutability, composition, and explicit data flow.
   - Avoid unnecessary side effects.

2. Prioritize project preferences over personal preferences.
   - Follow the repository's existing style, architecture, and conventions.
   - Do not refactor other people's code unless explicitly requested.
   - When writing new code personally requested by Luke, use these
     preferences as long as they do not conflict with project rules.

3. Treat this as a shared, editable agreement.
   - This file is maintained collaboratively by Luke and OpenCode.
   - OpenCode may modify this file only with Luke's explicit permission.
